## Visualization

- [ ] Source code visualization

It would be cool to visualize code in different ways, because right now navigating through the source code is a big mess.

I need to visualize code like nodes maybe.

When one calls something from somewhere else, or for example my problem right now is:

```problem_xd
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './.cache/routes/auth/confirmationEmailPrivateKey.json'
```

I need to visualize where that file comes from, and what it does.
